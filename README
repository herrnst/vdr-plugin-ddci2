Description
-----------

A plugin which creates DVB CI adapters from "stand alone" ca-devices
like the ones from Digital Devices.
This plugin will work ONLY with VDR version 2.1.7 and newer.

The CI devices of Digital Devices or Linux4Media are not bound to a
dedicated DVB adapter. There will be only a ca- and a ci-device. The
ca-device has to be used like every other ca-device, but the packets
to be descrambled have to be written to and read from the ci-device.
This plugin obsolets the redirect method of the ddbridge kernel driver.
The Kernel driver must not started with option "adapter_alloc=1|2|3"!


Plugin Commandline
------------------

Use vdr -h to see the command line arguments supported by the plugin.

  -c        --clrsct       clear the scambling control bit before the
                           packet is send to VDR
  -l        --loglevel     0/1/2/3 log nothing/error/info/debug
  -d        --debugmask    Bitmask to enable special debug logging
                           0x0001 ... all what the developer thought
                                      should be logged in debug default
                           0x0002 ... file access during init
                           0x0400 ... CAM data read/write access (heavy
                                      logging)
                           0x0800 ... Scrambling control

The default loglevel is info.
The default debug logging mask is 0x0001. You can use option -d several
times. All the values are ORed to one mask. Don't forget the "0x"!


Pitfalls
--------

If you see this message in syslog:
  DDCI-Err (ddci2.cpp,110): Couldn't open /dev/dvb/adapterX/ciY with mode 0x800:
          Device or resource busy
then you might forget to remove the redirect assignment in the driver.


Building the plugin

*****************************************************************************
**
**  NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE
**
**  This Plugin reqires version 0.9.13 of the ddbridge Kernel driver suite
**  available here:
**    http://download.digital-devices.de/download/linux/
**
**  And the Remove_188_byte_limit_in_ts_write patch available here:

*****************************************************************************

The usual way is to compile VDR plugins from within the VDR source tree.
Checkout the plugin source tree or unpack the tgz file below
  .../vdr/PLUGINS/src

To checkout the source use:
  $ git clone git://github.com/jasmin-j/vdr-plugin-ddci2.git ddci2

If you have unpacked the tarball, the directory ddci2-<VERSION> needs to be
renamed to ddci2. Otherwise the VDR plugin make system will not find it.

To compile the plugin without the VDR plugin make system, look to the
description in Makefile.
