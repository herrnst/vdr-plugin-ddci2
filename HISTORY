2017-03-19 Version 0.2.1
- Added scrambling bit modification
- New option '-c' / "--clrsct" to activate clearing the scambling control bit
  before the packet is send to VDR. Might be useful for some stupid CAMs.
- New debug mask "0x0800" for scrambling control debug printing
- Remove packets when not decrypting.

2017-03-11 Version 0.2.0

  This has been found by Klaus S. THX!

2017-03-06 Version 0.0.14

  - The Plugin does no longer automatically assign a CAM to a device. It will
    be assigned to a device, when VDR needs a CAM.
  - Added system error text if ciX/cax device open fails.
  - New version 0.0.14, requires VDR 2.1.7.
- Added section Pitfallsto README.

2014-04-11 Version 0.0.13

- Remove ddcireadbuf.* to avoid VDR patch.
- Updated README concerning the required Kernel patch. 

2014-04-11 Version 0.0.12

- Associate ciX device only to devices without a caX device.
- Global definition to activate the buffer statistics.   

2014-04-10 Version 0.0.11

- Removed annoying debug output.

2014-04-10 Version 0.0.10

2014-04-09 Version 0.0.9

- Rename the ReadJunk function and the description.

2014-04-09 Version 0.0.8

- Decrypt writes now the TS frames one by one to the send buffer.

2014-04-07: Version 0.0.7

- NOTE: This is an Intermediate commit!
        This Plugin is currently not working propperly!
- Workarround for missing access to camSlots array in cCiAdapter.
- Added a receive buffer to the CAM slot class and all required functions to
  fill this buffer.
- Added Buffer clearing on CAM reset and decrypt start/stop.
- Added an independend deliver thread to the TS receiver thread.
- Added test statistik counters and printouts (partly disabled).
- Extended cRingBufferLinear with a block read function with derived class
  DdCiRecvBuf.

2014-04-04: Version 0.0.6

- NOTE: This is an Intermediate commit!
        This Plugin is currently not working propperly!
- Introduce DdCiTsRecv class and new file for common functions.
- Added an error message, when not all TS data could be written to the CAM.
- If environment variable DEBUG is set, the compiler is invoked with no
  optimization option. This is usefull for GDB debugging.

2014-03-30: Version 0.0.5

- NOTE: This is an Intermediate commit!
        This Plugin is currently not working propperly!
- Introduce DdCiCamslot and DdCiTsSend classes.
- Startup and cleanup reworked and tested.
- Coding style changes.
- Logging and debugging macros reworked.
  NOTE: Starting with this commit, the drivers redirect
        feature must no longer be used!  

2014-03-29: Version 0.0.4

- Communication with caX device working:
  * Argument parsing is now working.
  * Fixed double delete error in FindDdCi.
- Added function debugging for development.

2014-03-28: Version 0.0.3

- Intermediate commit before HW tests are starting:
  * Added newest GPLv2 COPYING file.
  * The dependencies are now recreated, if a source file changes.
  * README improved.
  * Added file headers to all source files.
  * The plugin is now ready to find the DD CI device files and to initialize
    them. It will communicate viw the .../caX device to the CAM.
    NOTE: The .../ciX device is currently not used! So you do still need the
          drivers redirect feature to get a descambled stream.  

2014-03-25: Version 0.0.2

- Dummy source file added.
- Makefile ready to compile the plugin.
